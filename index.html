<!-- In this project we're creating an openBoard where we can draw, write and do everything that is done in a digital board -->

<!-- Below are the points that we've mainly learnt in this code snippet :-
1.-> Canvas (used to draw anything in the html page)
2.-> window.innerHeight; (used to assign the height for the board of canvas)
3.-> window.innerWidth;  (used to assign the width for the board of canvas)
4.-> getContext("2d");  (used to make the canvas working, like canvas me draw karne k liye ye line likhna parega)
5.-> rect()	(used to create a rectangle)
6.-> strokeRect()  -> Draws a border of rectangle(no filled)   // tool.strokeRect(startCoordinate, endCoordinate, width, height);
7.-> fillRect()	Draws a "filled" rectangle   (default color is black   // tool.fillReact(startCoordinate, endCoordinate, width, height);
8.-> clearRect()	Clears the specified pixels within a given rectangle   // tool.fillReact(startCoordinate, endCoordinate, width, height);
9.-> fillStyle() function is used before creating the rectangle and it's used to color the rectangle (as the default color is black), but by using fillStyle (tool.fillStyle ="colorName";) we can easily change the color of the shape to our desired color.
10-> strokeStyle() function is used before creating the rectangle with boundaries and it's used to color the boundaries of rectangle as the default color is black, but by using strokeStyle (tool.strokeStyle ="colorName";) we can easily change the color of the boundary of the rectangle;

    <h1>Canvas Example</h1>
    <!-- <canvas id="myCanvas" width="100" height="100"></canvas>     ( <-- this is also a way to make a canvas ) -->
    <!--In above line we are Passing values via inline css-->
    <!-- Now below we're Drawing Board using canvas -->
    <!-- Canvas is used for making a board for drawing anything,writing anything, basically for graphics -->
    <!-- Kisi bhi html page me agar tumhe drawing karni hai tho tum wo chij canvas tag use karke kar skte ho -->
    <canvas></canvas>
    <!-- Just by writing this canvas tag our board will be made on the screen and below we will grab this canvas tag in the internal javascript using the document keyword of the dom and also use the querySelector and by it we'll grab the canvas and start working on the board -->
</body>
<!-- Below we're injecting javascript in this html file using Internal Javascript -->
<script>
    let canvasBoard = document.querySelector("canvas");
    // default height and width is smaller for the canvas so to cover the whole screen we use the window height and width(i.e used in the below two lines)
    canvasBoard.height = window.innerHeight;    //// window full screen ko bolte hai, aaur usme ak property hoti hai which is said as innerHeight by which we get the height of page
    canvasBoard.width = window.innerWidth;      //// window full screen ko bolte hai, aaur usme ak property hoti hai which is said as innerWidth by which we get the width of page
    // canvasBoard.height = 500;    // if we don't want the board to be off full screen size then we can write the above two lines in this way too by directly assigning them size 
    // canvasBoard.width = 600;

    // this below line gives you the tool to draw on that canvas
    let tool = canvasBoard.getContext("2d");    // canvas me draw karne k liye ye line likhna parega(variableInWhichTheCanvasTagIsGrabbed.getContext("2d")); 2d is just the dimension i.e two dimension me sara kam/work/drawings hongi

    /* Now in an open board we have to draw lines right, 
    so to draw lines our screen should know where we've pressed in the screen and where we're leaving the pressed mouse or pointer
    ki kaha sae kaha tak pen chalega iske liye hame starting + ending point tho pta hona chaiye,
    like if we want to draw a straight line so for that our screen should know the starting point(i.e when is the mouse pressed) and also the ending point(i.e where the mouse is left taki waha tak ak line draw ho jai)
    so for the screen to know ki user ne kaha par starting and ending press kiya hai so for that we have EventListener in javaScript which works for both starting and ending point
    we just need to use[-> addEventListener("mousedown") <--this mousedown means ki screen understand krega ki we have pressed the mouse and now form there it is the starting point of the mouse] this works for every events(like pressing of mouse, keyboard, microphone etc) but here we're only using to check the event(starting and ending point) of the mouse
    we just need to use[-> addEventListener("mouseup") <--this mouseup means ki screen understand krega ki we have left the mouse and now till here the line must be drawn] this works for every events(like pressing of mouse, keyboard, microphone etc) but here we're only using to check the event(starting and ending point) of the mouse
    so inside it we use logic and in that we use clientX and clientY (to know the starting coordinate of x and y (jaise graph me hota hai x and y likewise to know the starting coordinates of x and y))
    So To IDENTIFY THE PRESSING AND RELEASING ON THE SCREEN WE DO THE BELOW JAVASCRIPT CODE
    */
    let bodyPressing = document.querySelector("body");    // we're working on the body so we're grabbing the body in this line and assigning it to the bodyPressing variable and working with it by adding the EventListener for mousedown and mouseup, so that everything happens in the body.
    //below we're doing to get the starting point coordinate of x and y
    let iX, iY, fX, fY;  // defining these outside as we need to use it in different callback functions
    bodyPressing.addEventListener("mousedown", function (e) {
        // alert("mouse was pressed on the body");
        // console.log(e);
        // let xPosition = e.clientX;      // here in the xPosition variable we're assigning the starting point coordinate of x using [-->  object.clientX ]
        // let yPosition = e.clientY;      // here in the yPosition variable we're assigning the starting point coordinate of y using [-->  object.clientY ]
        // console.log(xPosition, yPosition);   // and just for the verification we're printing the starting coordinates of x and y which we had stored above..
        iX = e.clientX;
        iY = e.clientY;
    })

    //below we're doing to get the ending point coordinate of x and y
    bodyPressing.addEventListener("mouseup", function (e) {
        // alert("mouse was released from the body");
        // console.log(e);
        // let endingXPosition = e.clientX;   // here in the endingXPosition variable we're assigning the ending point coordinate of x using [-->  object.clientX ]
        // let endingYPosition = e.clientY;   // here in the endingYPosition variable we're assigning the ending point coordinate of y using [-->  object.clientY ]
        // console.log(endingXPosition, endingYPosition);   // and just for the verification we're printing the ending coordinates of x and y which we had stored above..
        fX = e.clientX;
        fY = e.clientY;
        let width = fX - iX;
        let height = fY - iY;
        tool.strokeStyle = "blue";
        tool.strokeRect(iX, iY, width, height);
    })
